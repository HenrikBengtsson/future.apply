# Version 1.10.0 [2022-11-04]

## Bug Fixes

 * Functions `future_eapply()`, `future_lapply()`, `future_sapply()`,
   and `future_vapply()` failed if `FUN` was specified as the name of
   a function rather than the function object itself,
   e.g. `future_lapply(1:3, FUN = "sqrt")`.

## Deprecated and Defunct

 * Specifying the function `FUN` for `future_by()` as a character
   string is deprecated, because `base::by()` does not support it. It
   should be specified as a function, e.g. `FUN = sqrt` and ``FUN =
   `[[` ``.


# Version 1.9.1 [2022-09-07]

## Bug Fixes

 * Some warnings and errors showed the wrong call.

## Miscellaneous

 * Fix some HTML5 issues in help pages.
 

# Version 1.9.0 [2022-04-24]

## Signficant Changes

 * `future_mapply()` and `future_Map()` was updated to match the new
   behavior of `mapply()` and `Map()` in R (>= 4.2.0), which follows
   the "max-or-0-if-any" recycling rule.

## Performance

 * Now captured standard output and conditions are deleted as soon as
   they have been relayed. This requires **future** (>= 1.25.0).

## Deprecated and Defunct

 * Removed moot argument `future.lazy` from all functions. Regardless
   of setting it to TRUE or FALSE, futures would be resolved
   momentarily and always before the apply returned.


# Version 1.8.1 [2021-08-09]

## Bug Fixes

 * `citEntry()` in CITATION used argument `notes` instead of `note`.
 

# Version 1.8.0 [2021-08-09]

## New Features

 * Add argument `future.envir` to all `future_nnn()` functions, which
   is passed as argument `envir` to `future()`.

 * Add option `future.apply.debug` for debugging features specific to
   this package.  It defaults to option `future.debug`.
 
## Performance

 * Internal `getGlobalsAndPackagesXApply()` now avoids calculating the
   object size of `...` arguments if option `future.globals.maxSize`
   is +Inf.

## Bug Fixes

 * `f <- function(...) future_lapply(X, function(x) list(...));
   f(a=1)` would produce an error on 'unused argument (a = 1)" with
   the upcoming release of **future** 1.22.0.
 

# Version 1.7.0 [2021-01-02]

## New Features

 * The automatic capturing of conditions can be disabled by specifying
   `future.conditions = NULL`.

 * Warnings and errors on using the RNG without specifying
   `future.seed` are now tailored to the **future.apply** package.


# Version 1.6.0 [2020-06-30]

## Signficant Changes

 * `future_apply()` gained argument `simplify`, which is added to
   R-devel (to become R 4.1.0).

## Bug Fixes

 * `future_apply(X, FUN, ...)` would pass all `future.*` arguments
   except `future.globals`, `future.packages`, and `future.labels` to
   the `FUN` function instead of processing them locally.  This would
   often result in the `FUN` producing an error on "unused argument".
   It also affected `future.seed` not being applied, which means for
   some `FUN` functions that did not produce this error,
   non-reproducible results could have been produced.
   

# Version 1.5.0 [2020-04-16]

## New Features

 * Add `future_.mapply()` corresponding to `.mapply()` in the **base**
   package.

## Bug Fixes

 * `future_mapply()` would chunk up `MoreArgs` when `future.seed =
   TRUE`.
 

# Version 1.4.0 [2020-01-06]

## New Features

 * Now all `future_nnn()` functions set a label on each future that
   reflects the name of the `future_nnn()` function and the index of
   the chunk, e.g.  `"future_lapply-3"`. The format can be controlled
   by argument `future.label`.

## Performance

 * The assertion of the maximum size of globals per chunk is now
   significantly faster for `future_apply()`.

## Bug Fixes

 * `future_lapply(X)` and `future_mapply(FUN, X)` would drop `names`
   argument of the returned empty list when `length(X) == 0`.

 * Package could set `.Random.seed` to NULL, instead of removing it,
   which in turn would produce a warning on "'.Random.seed' is not an
   integer vector but of type 'NULL', so ignored" when the next random
   number generated.
 

# Version 1.3.0 [2019-06-17]

## New Features

 * Now `future.conditions` defaults to the same as argument
   `conditions` of `future::future()`.  If the latter changes, this
   package will follow.
 
 * Debug messages are now prepended with a timestamp.

## Bug Fixes

 * The error "sprintf(...) : 'fmt' length exceeds maximal format
   length 8192" could be produced when debugging tried to report on
   too many globals.
 

# Version 1.2.0 [2019-03-06]

## New Features

 * Added `future_by()`.

## Bug Fixes

 * Attributes `add` and `ignore` of argument `future.globals` were
   ignored although support for them was added in **future** (>=
   1.10.0).

 * Validation of L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG seeds failed in recent R devel.
 

# Version 1.1.0 [2019-01-16]

## Signficant Changes

 * Added argument `future.stdout` and `future.conditions` for
   controlling whether standard output and conditions (e.g. messages
   and warnings) produced during the evaluation of futures should be
   captured and relayed or not.  Standard output is guaranteed to be
   relayed in the same order as it would when using sequential
   processing.  Analogously for conditions.  However, standard output
   is always relayed before conditions.  Errors are always relayed.
   Relaying of non-error conditions requires **future** (>= 1.11.0).
   
## New Features

 * Elements can be processed in random order by setting attribute
   `ordering` to `"random"` of argument `future.chunk.size` or
   `future.scheduling`, e.g.  `future.chunk.size = structure(TRUE,
   ordering = "random")`.  This can help improve load balancing in
   cases where there is a correlation between processing time and
   ordering of the elements.  Note that the order of the returned
   values is not affected when randomizing the processing order.
 
 * Swapped order of arguments `future.lazy` and `future.seed` to be
   consistent with ditto arguments of `future::future()`.
 

# Version 1.0.1 [2018-08-26]

## Documentation / Licence

 * The license is GPL (>= 2).  Previously it was documented as GPL (>=
   2.1) but that is a non-existing GPL version.

## Bug Fixes

 * For list objects `X` where `X != as.list(X), future_lapply(X)` did
   not give the same result as `lapply(X)`.  Analogously for
   `future_vapply(X)`.
   
 * `future_mapply()` could drop class attribute on elements iterated
   over, because `.subset()` was used internally instead of `` `[`()
   ``.  For instance, iteration over `Date` objects were affected.


# Version 1.0.0 [2018-06-19]

## Signficant Changes

 * License changed from LGPL (>= 2.1) to GPL (>= 2) to make sure it is
   compatible with the source code adopted from R base's `apply()`,
   `Map()`, `replicate()`, `sapply()`, and `tapply()`, which are all
   GPL (>= 2).
 
## New Features

 * Added `future_apply()`, `future_mapply()`, and `future_Map()`.

 * Added argument `future.chunk.size` as an alternative to argument
   `future.scheduling` for controlling the average number of elements
   processed per future ("chunk").  In R 3.5.0, the **parallel**
   package introduced argument `chunk.size`.

 * The maximum total size of globals allowed (option
   `future.globals.maxSize`) per future ("chunk") is now scaled up by
   the number of elements processed by the future ("chunk") making the
   protection approximately invariant to the amount of chunking
   (arguments `future.scheduling` and `future.chunk.size`).
 
## Bug Fixes

 * `future_lapply(X, ...)` did not search for globals in `X`.

 * `future_vapply()` did not return the same dimension names as
   `vapply()` when `FUN.VALUE` had no names but `FUN(X[[1]])` had.
 
## Software Quality

 * Test code coverage is 100%.
 
 
# Version 0.2.0 [2018-05-01]

## New Features

 * Added `future_eapply()`, `future_tapply()`, `future_vapply()`, and
   `future_replicate()`.
 

# Version 0.1.0 [2018-01-15]

 * Package submitted to CRAN.


# Version 0.0.3 [2017-12-06]

## Documentation

 * Vignette now covers the basics of the package and describes its
   role in the R package ecosystem together with a road map going
   forward.

## Software Quality

 * Added more package tests.  Code coverage is currently at 100%.


# Version 0.0.2 [2017-12-06]

## Performance

 * `future_lapply(x, ...)` is now much faster and more memory
   efficient for large `x` vectors because it uses internal `fold()`
   function that is more efficient (memory and speed) version of
   `base::Reduce(f, x)`, especially when `length(x)` is large.


# Version 0.0.0-9000 [2017-08-31]

## New Features

 * Added `future_sapply()`.

 * Added `future_lapply()` - originally from the **future** package.
 
 * Created package.
